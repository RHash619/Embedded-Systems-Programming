Simply use the built-in USART hardware of the AVR to transmit a serial string that contains your Red ID.You must set up the USART'sserial mode and bit rate (a.k.a. baud rate) to 9600bits/sec, 8 data bits,  1  stop  bit,  and  poll  the  transmit  status  register  to  wait  until  it  is  readybefore  writing anoutput data byte to the USART's serial data register.The final output demonstration of the assignment is to showthecharacters corresponding to the 9  digits  of  your  Red  ID  followed  by  carriage  returnand  linefeedfollowed  by  a  500msdelay which must berepeated continuouslyat 9600 bits per second (one-bitperiod = 1/9600 seconds, ~100us/bit, for10 bits,~1ms per character).The  Atmel  Xplained  Mini  board  will  be  the  Transmitter,  you mustset  up  your  computer  as  a USART  (Serial)  Receiver  using  PuTTY  and  the  FT232R  Breakout  boardfor  the  final  lab  3 demonstration.
